# Edgee HTML demo website

This is a simple HTML website that demonstrates how to use Edgee on a website.

```bash
## Go wherever you want
git clone git@github.com:edgee-cloud/demo-html.git
cd demo-html
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then you can go to http://localhost:8080/

But to be able to use the power of Edgee you need to launch the [`edgee`](https://github.com/edgee-cloud/edgee) proxy 
and set it up with a backend pointing to http://localhost:8080/
